# Getting Started

LTI 1.3 is an open standard.
Many Learning Management System (LMS) vendors support the LTI 1.3 standard and as such vendors are able to integrate with various LMS's as External Tools.

Start by navigating to your [LMS vendor's integration section](lms-integration.md) to register the installation and configuration steps.
During the tool registration process, you should obtain the following information which is necessary to complete the setup of the LTI Authenticator plugin:

- `issuer`: URL of the LMS platform used for identification
- `client_id`: opaque ID of the tool registration at the platform

```{note}
If your LMS is not listed feel free to send us a PR with instructions for this new LMS.
```

Then, follow the steps below to configure your JupyterHub with the basic settings.
See the [configuration reference](reference) for a complete list of available configuration options.

## Basic Settings

The required settings to get authentication via LTI 1.3 to work are:

- `issuer`: the URL of your LMS platform. If your LMS is served from `https://canvas.instructure.com`, the issuer is `https://canvas.instructure.com`.
- `client_id`: opaque ID, typically generated by the LMS when a tool is registered there.
- `authorize_url`: Authorization endpoint of the LMS platform. The URL to which authorization requests are sent by the authenticator as part of the [OIDC implicit flow](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/implicit-flow-with-form-post).
  E.g. `https://canvas.instructure.com/api/lti/authorize_redirect`.
- `jwks_endpoint`: An endpoint of the LMS from which JupyterHub can obtain the [JWKS](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-key-sets) to verify and decode any received [JWT](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens).
  E.g. `https://canvas.instructure.com/api/lti/security/jwks`.

A valid minimal configuration in the `jupyterhub_config,py` may look like this

```python
c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = "ltiauthenticator.lti13.auth.LTI13Authenticator"

# Define issuer identifier of the LMS platform
c.LTI13Authenticator.issuer = "https://canvas.instructure.com"

# Add the LTI 1.3 configuration options
c.LTI13Authenticator.authorize_url = "https://canvas.instructure.com/api/lti/authorize_redirect"

# The platform's JWKS endpoint url providing public key sets used to verify the ID token
c.LTI13Authenticator.jwks_endpoint = "https://canvas.instructure.com/api/lti/security/jwks"

# The external tool's client id as represented within the platform (LMS)
c.LTI13Authenticator.client_id = "125900000000000329"
```

## Username Key Setting

The username is inferred from the ID token sent by the platform (LMS) during the login flow based on the setting of the `username_key` traitlet.
The default is `email` but all other top-level claims of the ID token may be chosen.
The list of available values depends on the LMS vendor you are using and how your LMS is configured, but you may take a look at [this example](http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/#examplelinkrequest) to get an idea of the available values.
If you are in doubt about the content of the ID token sent by your LMS, you may use [an external test tool](https://saltire.lti.app/tool) with your LMS to capture the ID token.

Your LMS may provide additional keys in the LTI 1.3 login initiation flow that you can use to set the username.
In most cases these are located in the `https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/claim/custom` claim.
In this case, `username_key` must be prefixed with "custom\_".
For example, `username_key="custom_uname"` will set the username to the value of the parameter `uname` within the `https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/claim/custom` claim.

You may also have the option of using [variable substitutions](http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/#customproperty) to fetch values that aren't provided with your vendor's standard LTI 1.3 login initiation flow request.

If your platform's LTI 1.3 settings are defined with privacy enabled or if the given `username_key` is not found within the ID token, then by default the `sub` claim is used to set the username.
This claim contains a unique and opaque user ID generated by the platform.

The example below illustrates how to fetch the user's given name to set the JupyterHub username:

```python
# Set the user's email as their user id
c.LTI13Authenticator.username_key = "given_name"
```

## Configuration JSON Settings

The LTI 1.3 configuration JSON settings are available at `/lti13/config` endpoint.
Some LMS vendors accept URLs that render the configuration JSON to simplify the LTI 1.3 tool installation process.
You may customize these settings with the `tool_name` and `tool_description` configuration options.

## Custom Configuration with JupyterHub's Helm Chart

If you are running **JupyterHub within a Kubernetes Cluster**, deployed using helm, you need to supply the LTI 1.3 (OIDC/OAuth2) endpoints and required out-of-band registration settings. The example below also demonstrates how customize the `username_key` to set the user's give name:

```yaml
# Custom config for JupyterHub's helm chart
hub:
  config:
    # Additional documentation related to authentication and authorization available at
    # https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/administrator/authentication.html
    JupyterHub:
      authenticator_class: ltiauthenticator.lti13.auth.LTI13Authenticator
    LTI13Authenticator:
      # Use an LTI 1.3 claim to set the username. You can use and LTI 1.3 claim that
      # identifies the user, such as email, last_name, etc.
      username_key: "given_name"
      # The issuer identifyer of the platform
      issuer: "https://canvas.instructure.com"
      # The LTI 1.3 authorization url
      authorize_url: "https://canvas.instructure.com/api/lti/authorize_redirect"
      # The external tool's client id as represented within the platform (LMS)
      # Typically created by the platform when registering the tool.
      client_id: "125900000000000329"
      # The platform's JWKS endpoint url providing public key sets used to verify the ID token
      jwks_endpoint: "https://canvas.instructure.com/api/lti/security/jwks"
```

## Deal with Synchronization Issues (iat, nbf, exp)

The underlying OIDC Implicit flow protocol requires some checks involving token issuing time.
In particular, a token must not be issued in the future.
Since the LMS and JupyterHub are likely not running on the same machine, it is possible that those two machines may have unsynchronized clocks.
This may lead to false rejection of a valid token with an HTTP Code `400: "The token is not yet valid (...)"`.
To deal with this situation, it is possible to configure a leeway time in seconds to relax the strictness of the time-based checks.
The following configuration will allow for a discrepancy of 10 seconds between the clocks of both servers

```python
c.LTI13LaunchValidator.time_leeway = 10
```

```{note}
The class being configured is `LTI13LaunhValidator`.
For a complete list of its configuration options, see the [configuration reference](reference.md#lti13launchvalidator).
```
