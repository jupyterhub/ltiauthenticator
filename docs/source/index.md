This website documents the use of an authenticator plugin for JupyterHub for use against [LTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Tools_Interoperability) based authentication systems.
The plugin supports the both the [LTI 1.1](https://www.imsglobal.org/specs/ltiv1p1/implementation-guide) and [LTI 1.3](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3).

```{note}
LTI 1.1 is [deprecated](https://www.imsglobal.org/lti-security-announcement-and-deprecation-schedule) and LTI 1.3 should be the preferred choice.
